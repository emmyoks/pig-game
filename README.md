During each turn in the game, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold." If a player rolls a 1, they get no points, and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to the player's turn total, and their turn continues. When a player chooses to "hold," their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach a score of 100 or more points wins the game.
